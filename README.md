## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## App Brainstorming

1. Strava - new AI features, follower interactions
2. Tiktok - ease of video creation, algorithm
3. Messages - user friendly, accessible and simple

I would like to build an app for runners to track very specific metrics based on their own health data from a wearable device.
